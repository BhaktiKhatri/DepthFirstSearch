/**
 * Leetcode 210. Course Schedule II
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/description/
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1. 
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
 * There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
 * For example: 2, [[1,0]]
 * There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1]
 * 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]] 
 * There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is[0,2,1,3].
 * Note: The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
 * You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

	 	The idea is to start from courses upon which no other courses will depend(These courses all have the least priority and should come at the last in the
	 	order list). Then do standard BFS on these courses and try to find courses that have next level of priority(These courses will come right before the least
	 	priority courses in the order list). And continue the process until we have no more courses to deal with. If there is no cycle in the prerequisites graph,
	 	then in this way we should be able to deal with all the courses. Otherwise there will be remaining courses left untended. See the comments in the code for
	 	more information.
